  !SQL is NOT case-sensitive, though "KEY_WORD other_stuff" is a widespread syntax.
  !Separate statements from each other with ";"

DBs contain several objects:
1.Tables - store data
2.Views - can combine data from multiple tables and show them. Used for reports, etc.
3.Stored procedures - little functions for querying data
4.Functions - little functions for querying data

Records - are rows in the table.

- Line with "--" in the beginnning is considered a comment
!- Order of the clauses and statements is important. Otherwise we get Syntax Error.

- Every table in MYSQL has a key column.

      
      ALIAS

- Aside of using the word ALIAS when trying to create one, we can use a shorter syntax for table names. We can abbreviate tables by writing their 1st letter after its full name.
!- After giving alias to a table, we MUST use that. Using the original name will result in an error.


    Column Attributes:

- Each column has its attributes, for example Datatype may have INT([number about length]), VARCHAR, DATE, etc.
- Some column names: PK - primary key, NN - not null, AI - auto increment, Default / Expression - if no default is provided, it will use null or '0' for INTs.
