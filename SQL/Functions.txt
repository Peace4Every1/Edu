MySQL functions:

LAST_INSERT_ID() - gets the id of the newly inserted record, usually gets written after the INSERT statement.


    Aggregate functions:

Those are the functions that combine several values into a single result.
MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM, COUNT() - examples.
* - means all
- COUNT by default will count also repeating values, to make it count only unique fields, we must use DISTINCT.

Ex:
  SELECT MAX(invoice_total) AS highest,
    MIN(invoice_total) AS lowest,
    AVG(invoice_total) AS average,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total,
    COUNT(invoice_total) AS number_of_invoices,
    COUNT(payment_date) AS count_of_payments,
    COUNT(DISTINCT client_id) AS total_records,
    COUNT(*) AS total_rec
  FROM invoices
  WHERE invoice_date > '2019-07-01'

  SELECT 'First half of 2019' AS data_range,
	  SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
    SUM(payment_total) AS total_payments,
    SUM(invoice_total - payment_total) AS what_we_expect
  FROM invoices
  WHERE invoice_date
	BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-06-30'
