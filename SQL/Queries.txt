Writing a GET query, SELECT clause:
1. Select a DB to execute a query against it. - USE db_name
2. Use select statement for retrieving data. - SELECT column_name, second_column (alternative is using *, which means "all columns")
3. Specify the table to make a query from. - FROM table_name
  Ex: SELECT * FROM customers

Writing a filtering query, WHERE clause, then sorting with ORDER_BY:
Ex: SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1 ORDER BY first_name


    SELECT Clause:

- We can execute math expressions against db values.
Ex:
  SELECT last_name, first_name, points * 20 + 300

- Retrieve unique lists with query with DISTINCT.
Ex: 
  SELECT DISTINCT state FROM customers

    AS:

- We can assign aliases to different columns:
Ex:
  SELECT last_name, first_name, points * 20 + 300 AS discount_factor (or) 'discount factor'



    WHERE Clause:

- We use this for filtering data.
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE state = 'VA'

-Operator list: >, <, >=, <=, =, != or <>

!- SQL can treat dates in string format like numbers. Default date format is YYYY-MM-DD
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01'

  SELECT * FROM orders WHERE placement_date >= '2020-01-01'



    AND, OR, NOT operators:

- With these operators we are able to use multiple conditions at the same time.
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01' AND points > 1000
  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000 AND state = 'VA'
  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT (birth_date <= '1990-01-01' AND points > 1000)

- Order of operators, without overriding them with (). AND - 1, OR - 2

SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE order_id = 6 AND quantity * unit_price > 30


    IN operator:

Instead of writing something like this -
  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE state = 'VA' OR state = 'GA' OR state = 'FL'
We can use the IN operator.
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE state IN ('VA', 'FL', 'GA')
  
- IN operator is made for comparing an attribute with a list of different values. !The values get treated like with OR operator.

Subquery with IN:
Ex:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE product_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT product_id
    FROM order_items
  )

    BETWEEN operator:

Instead of writing -
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points >= 1000 AND points <= 3000
We can use BETWEEN operator.
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000

- BETWEEN operator is used when comparing values


    LIKE operator:

- LIKE gets used when we need to match a pattern.
!- LIKE is NOT case-sensitive.
- % means any amount of any letters, equivalent of * in common search systems.
- _ means a single character, equiv. to ? in common search systems.
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name LIKE 'a____b%'

  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE address LIKE '%TRAIL%' OR address LIKE '%AVENUE%'
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE phone_number LIKE %9


    REGEXP operator:

- The same as in every other programming language.
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name REGEXP '[a-h]e'

- REG operators are:
^ - beginning
$ - end
| - logical or
[abcd] - before or after a char to make the items before it limited by the array elements
[a-f]


    IS NULL operator:

- With this operator we can find out if the value is null.
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE phone IS NULL

- We can also use NOT with IS NULL
EX:
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE phone IS NOT NULL


    ORDER BY operator:

- It is meant for sorting the query results. (ASC default.)
- When needed to get results in descending order, write DESC after order by's argument.
- We can order columns enumerating, by writing the columns with ","
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country, City
  
- ORDER BY 1,2 executes sorting by column positions, which is a BAD PRACTICE
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY first_name DESC
Results here are sorted by their first_names in descending order and not by their !table keys


    LIMIT clause:

- For limiting the results for executing a query
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 300

- For skipping some results we can pass them as first arguments to LIMIT
Ex:
  SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 6,3


    GROUP BY clause:

- This clause must always be after FROM and WHERE.
We use this when we need to group data by 1 or more columns.
Ex:
  SELECT
    client_id,
    state,
    city,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
  FROM invoices i
  JOIN clients USING (client_id)
  GROUP BY state, city

  SELECT
    date,
    SUM(amount) AS total_payments
  FROM payments p
  JOIN payment_methods pm
    ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
  GROUP BY date
  ORDER BY date

    Adding custom columns:

You can add a custom column name to queried col names by adding a string.
Ex:
  SELECT customer_id, first_name, points, 'Bronze' AS type FROM customers WHERE points < 2000


    HAVING clause:

- We use this clause to filter data !after GROUP BY clause, because syntactically, it's impossible to use WHERE before GROUP BY, as the arguments of WHERE are unknown yet.
- Syntax is the same as WHERE's
Differences:
  - Unlike WHERE clause, we CAN NOT reference columns, that are not included in our SELECT, when WHERE can use any column names, despite them being included.

Ex:
  SELECT
    client_id,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_invoices
  FROM invoices
  WHERE
  GROUP BY client_id
  HAVING total_sales > 500 AND number_of_invoices > 5


    WITH ROLLUP operator:

- !NOT part of regular SQL, works in MYSQL, in other DBs, not guaranteed.  
- Operator for summarizing data, that applies only to the rows that aggregate values.
- In case we group by multiple columns, it will summarize both the results of each row, as well as all the rows alltogether.
Ex:
  SELECT
    state,
    city
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
  FROM invoices i
  JOIN clients c USING (client_id)
  GROUP BY state, city WITH ROLLUP









        SUBQUERY:

- We can use some queries as a part of another bigger query.
Exs:
  INSERT INTO orders_archived SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date < '2019-01-01'

  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE unit_price > (
    SELECT unit_price
    FROM products
    WHERE product_id = 3
  )

  USE sql_hr;
  SELECT *
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
  )
